### Why are the charts in their positions ? 
- **Figure 1** On the top for the sales Because the user needs to know sales by numbers
- **Figure 2** Left first row After knowing sales by numbers to know the general trend
- **Figure 3** 
Right first row After knowing sales trend and user need to sales by gender and the users read Left-to-right
- **Figure 4** 
Left Second row to know the sales distribution around the globe
